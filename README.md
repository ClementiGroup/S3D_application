Example codes of the workflow of S3D for folded proteins and IDPs

This repository provides the example codes of the whole workflow of S3D (Structure and State Space Decomposition). We use Villin as the example for fast-folding proteins and ACTR for intrinsically disordered proteins.

The workflow for fast-folding proteins contains:
  *TICA
